# Healthcare Cloud Service Homomorphic Encryption 

## Project Challenge 3
## Overview


This Git repository contains the source code, documentation, and other resources for the healthcare cloud service that uses homomorphic encryption to process sensitive healthcare data securely and efficiently. The service is designed to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of patient data while allowing computation on the encrypted data.

## Technology Stack
- Homomorphic Encryption
- Noise Reduction Methods (bootstrapping, squashing, and modulus switching)
- Encryption Key Generation, Encryption, and Decryption Algorithms
- Access Control and Authentication (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect)
- Containerization (Kubernetes and Docker)
- Cloud Provider (AWS or Google Cloud Platform)
- Python web framework, Django
- Database, SqLite


## Deployment Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the necessary dependencies for the cloud service
3. Set up the cloud provider account (AWS or Google Cloud Platform)
4. Generate the necessary encryption keys for the service
5. Deploy the service to Kubernetes or Docker using the deployment scripts in the `/scripts` directory
6. Test the service using the sample healthcare data in the `/data` directory
7. Monitor the service for scalability, fault-tolerance, and performance
8. Ensure the service complies with privacy regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR
